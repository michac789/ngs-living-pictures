The exhibition titled *Living Pictures: Photography in Southeast Asia* was a captivating journey through the evolving roles of photography in Southeast Asia. Held at the National Gallery Singapore from 2 December 2022 to 20 August 2023, it traced photography's transformation from a European exploratory tool to a medium of fine art and digital ubiquity in the region over 150 years. Visitors explored the artistic and documentary influences of photography through various lenses, including colonial explorations, studio portraits, wartime narratives and the contemporary digital age of memes and selfies. 

Accompanying the visual display was the exhibition catalogue *Living Pictures*, available in both print and eBook formats, offering an in-depth contemplation of photography's compelling history and its pervasive impact on cultural and individual identity.
